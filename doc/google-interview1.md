# Design a Podcast Platform?

This is the directional sense of how you can answer this question, don;t take it as full fledge solution, I just put the important element which I think is.

## Clarification Question
 - Understanding of Podcast — Audio only or Video as well
 - How are we? Do we already have a Podcast Platform? Are we trying to improve that platform or try to design for a particular Cohort? New Players trying to enter into market
 - Is it a mobile-based or Web-based Platform? Mobile Based
 - Any other Resource or Time constraint do we have? No

## High-Level Strategy: Why do we want a podcast platform?
